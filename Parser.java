/**
 * This class is part of the "Very Original Murder Mystery" application.
 * "Very Original Murder Mystery" is a simple, and very definitely original game
 * not at all derivative of Capcom's "Ace Attorney" series, which is completely
 * coincedentially the closest thing to a text adventure game I've ever played.
 * 
 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 * tries to interpret the line as a two-word command. It returns the command
 * as an object of class Command.
 *
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 * the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
 * returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
